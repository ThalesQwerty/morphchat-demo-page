Create an HTML/CSS preview of the page shown in the sent images.

This preview should be built in a single .html file within the /.cursor/temp folder at the project root (if this folder doesn't exist, create a new one),
with styles defined inside a <style> tag

Include the documentation specifications as comments in the .html file, this will help so that in the future this page can be converted to React
