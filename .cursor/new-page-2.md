Now, based on the HTML file you've just created, analyze the HTML and the project architecture to 
define a detailed strategy for transforming the HTML into a new React page within the project.

IMPORTANT:
- Pay attention to componentization, that is, reuse existing components or create new ones if applicable
- Maintain the existing project folder organization and code structure patterns
- Use existing SCSS variables and mixins
- Do not create documentation or example files

Explain to me the step-by-step process and motivations of your strategy and, if I approve, we will proceed.
