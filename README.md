## 🎉 Demo Website

The demo showcases MorphChat's capabilities through an interactive website that integrates the widget with real-time customization options. You can test:

#### 1. Theme Customization
Customize the widget visual appearance.

- **Primary Color**: Change the widget's main color scheme
- **Theme Mode**: Switch between light, dark, and auto modes
- **Widget Position**: Choose between different corner positions

#### 2. Profile Management
Customize the display names, avatar, and avatar visibility for both the user and the bot.
The changes are applied instantly to the widget.

#### 3. Page Actions
Enable and disable certain actions that can be triggered by sending messages to the bot.

#### 4. Bot Configuration
- **Prompt Instructions**: Set custom instructions for the AI assistant
- **Welcome Message**: Customize the bot's greeting
- **Status Management**: Control online/offline status and maintenance mode
- **Conversation Reset**: Clear chat history with localStorage persistence

### 👨‍💻 Install and run locally

To run the demo locally:

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThalesQwerty/morphchat-demo-page.git
cd morphchat-demo-page
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

#### 3. Configure OpenAI API Key
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**⚠️ Important**: Without this, the AI engine simply won't work. You can create your API key in the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

#### 4. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

#### 5. Open your browser
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the demo in action.

## 🧩 Library Usage

**📦 Library Repository**: [github.com/ThalesQwerty/morphchat](https://github.com/ThalesQwerty/morphchat)

### Installation

Install MorphChat via npm:

```bash
npm install morphchat
```

### Basic Setup 

Here's an example for a quick-start:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { useChatWidget } from "morphchat";

// Import global styles (required for proper styling)
import "morphchat/globals.scss";

function App() {
  const { component: ChatWidget } = useChatWidget({
    prompt: {
      apiKey: "your-openai-api-key",
      instructions: "You are an e-commerce AI-powered assistant. Help users the products available in the store."
      welcomeMessage: "Hello! How can I help you today?",
      model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    },
    theme: {
      primary: "#3b82f6",
      background: "#ffffff",
      text: "#1f2937",
    },
    corner: "right",
    mode: "dark",
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Website</h1>
      { ChatWidget }
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```tsx
const { component: ChatWidget } = useChatWidget({
// Theme configuration
theme: {
  primary: "#8b5cf6",
  background: "#ffffff",
  text: "#1f2937",
  borderRadius: "12px",
  fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif",
},

// Widget positioning and mode
corner: "left",
mode: "auto", // Follows system preference

// Bot and user profiles
botProfile: {
  name: "AI Assistant",
  avatar: "https://example.com/bot-avatar.png",
  showAvatar: true,
},
userProfile: {
  name: "User",
  avatar: "https://example.com/user-avatar.png",
  showAvatar: true,
},

// OpenAI configuration
prompt: {
  apiKey: process.env.REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY,
  welcomeMessage: "Welcome! I\"m here to help.",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant. Be concise and friendly.",
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  timeout: 30000,
  localStorage: true, // Persist conversations
},

// Custom intro
intro: {
  title: "Chat with AI",
  subtitle: "Ask me anything!",
},

// Event handlers
events: {
  onOpen: () => console.log("Chat opened"),
  onClose: () => console.log("Chat closed"),
  onSendMessage: (message) => console.log("Message sent:", message),
},

// Widget status
status: {
  isOnline: true,
  maintenanceMode: false,
  isOpen: false,
},
});
```

### Custom Actions

Define actions that the bot can trigger based on user interactions. Actions can have typed parameters that the AI can use to execute specific functions:

```tsx
const actions = [
  {
    name: "navigate",
    description: "Navigate to a specific page on the website",
    parameters: {
      page: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The page path to navigate to (e.g., \"products\", \"about\", \"contact\")",
        required: true,
      },
    },
    function: ({ page }) => {
      window.location.href = `/${page}`;
      return `Navigating to ${page} page...`;
    },
  },
  {
    name: "addToCart",
    description: "Add a product to the shopping cart",
    parameters: {
      productId: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The unique identifier of the product",
        required: true,
      },
      quantity: {
        type: "integer",
        description: "The quantity of the product to add (default: 1)",
        required: false,
      },
    },
    function: ({ productId, quantity = 1 }) => {
      // Add to cart logic here
      console.log(`Adding ${quantity} of product ${productId} to cart`);
      return `Added ${quantity} item(s) to your cart!`;
    },
  },
];

const { component: ChatWidget } = useChatWidget({
  prompt: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    actions,
    // ... other config
  },
  // ...other config
});
```
